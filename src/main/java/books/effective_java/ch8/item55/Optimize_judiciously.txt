More computing sins are committed in the name of efficiency (without necessarily
achieving it) than for any other single reason—including blind stupidity.
—William A. Wulf [Wulf72]

We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature
optimization is the root of all evil.
—Donald E. Knuth [Knuth74]

We follow two rules in the matter of optimization:
Rule 1. Don’t do it.
Rule 2 (for experts only). Don’t do it yet—that is, not until you have a
perfectly clear and unoptimized solution.
—M. A. Jackson [Jackson75]
